# Movie Ratings Analysis Using PySpark and PostgreSQL #

## Project Overview ##
  This project aims to analyze movie ratings using Apache Spark for data processing and PostgreSQL for data storage. 
  The goal is to gain insights into movie ratings, including average ratings by movie, the most rated movies, and average ratings by genre and year. 
  The project is implemented using PySpark, a powerful tool for distributed data processing, and PostgreSQL, a reliable and widely-used relational database management system.

## Technologies Used ##
  
  Python: The core programming language used for scripting and automation.
  
  PySpark: An open-source unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing.
  
  PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
  
  SQLAlchemy: A SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python.
  
  Matplotlib: A Python 2D plotting library for data visualization.
